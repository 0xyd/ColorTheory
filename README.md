# ColorTheory
Note of Color Theory

### Basic Color

There are three ways to describe colors: according to their names, how pure they are and how desaturated(去飽和的) they are. 

We often use Chroma(濃度), Intensity, Saturation and Luminance(亮度) used for describing colors.

Chroma: How pure is the hue in relation to gray.

Saturation: The degree of purity of a hue.

Intensity: The brightness or darkness of the hue.
Luminance: How much light will reflect from a hue. A Hue with white content has higher luminance.

Tint and Shade are variation of hue.
Tint: Color with more white addition
Shade: Color with more black addition

The middle is a pure red (rgb(255, 0, 0)) and it changes its color gradully to left and right directions.
While the color moves to the left side, the red mixes with more white which make it looks brighter.
Meanwhile, the color looks darker when it is approaching to the right side where it earns more black every single step.
