Note of Color Theory

### Basic Color

There are three ways to describe colors: according to their names, how pure they are and how desaturated(去飽和的) they are. 

We often use Chroma(濃度), Intensity, Saturation and Luminance(亮度) used for describing colors.

Chroma: How pure is the hue in relation to gray.

Saturation: The degree of purity of a hue.
Intensity: The brightness or darkness of the hue.
Luminance: How much light will reflect from a hue. A Hue with white content has higher luminance.
